Hi there! I'm a first year Ph.D. student of Department of Computer Science and Engineering at Michigan State University, advised by [Jiliang Tang](https://cse.msu.edu/~tangjili/) and [Hui Liu](https://www.egr.msu.edu/people/profile/liuhui7). Before joining DSE Lab, I was an RA at [Information Retrieval Lab](https://ir.sdu.edu.cn/index.htm) in SDU, working with [Zhaochun Ren](https://ir.sdu.edu.cn/~zhaochunren/), [Pengjie Ren](https://pengjieren.github.io/) and [Xin Xin](https://xinxin-me.github.io/).

<!-- Hi there! I'm a final year B.E. student of Electrical Engineering at ChongXin College(崇新学堂), Shandong University(SDU) and expected to graduate in June 2023. I joined [Information Retrieval Lab](https://ir.sdu.edu.cn/index.htm) in SDU a year ago, working with [Zhaochun Ren(任昭春)](https://ir.sdu.edu.cn/~zhaochunren/), [Pengjie Ren(任鹏杰)](https://pengjieren.github.io/) and [Xin Xin(辛鑫)](https://xinxin-me.github.io/). -->

<!-- I won first prize scholarships in Research Innovation and Aesthetic Education Accomplishment(Top 3%) and was selected Chongxin College.  -->
<!-- , supervised by Prof. [Honchao Zhou](https://faculty.sdu.edu.cn/zhouhongchao/zh_CN/index.htm). -->

My research interest is mainly recommender system and natural language processing. 

Email address: wangh137 at msu.edu


<!-- Here is My [CV](CV/HanbingWang.pdf) -->

<!-- I have a good command of English(IELTS: 7.5) and a good knowledge of recommender system. I'm familiar with popular recommendation algorithms, common datasets, training losses and evaluation metrics. I'm also good at programming to process datasets and implement ideas. 

Interest: Piano(Gr. 10), Electronic Organ(Gr. 10), Badminton(No.5 men's team in SDUQD).  -->

<!-- I am willing to learning new things and have good self-disipline and strong mental resiliency when facing adversities. Hopefully, we can speak about research in the future.  -->

<!-- Ascend project, Aizoo project, real time stytle transfer app, robot
communication courses,  -->


<!-- My research interest includes Data mining and recommendation system. I have submitted a paper as second author at the top international AI journals with total <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DhtAFkwAAAAJ'>google scholar </a><a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DhtAFkwAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>, and still have two papers in progress. I also own three patents in telecommunication.  -->
